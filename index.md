### CPSC 120

Lab 1
	Lab 1 was my favorite to begin with because it was the initiation to me learning more about programming. In Lab 1 I was able to learn the basic functions of how to change directories, clone a repository, as well as making my PAT token, after which I was then able to edit a file to have it say “Hello” with my name after instead of “Hello World!” as well as being able to insert a header. Where I was also able to learn how to commit and push my message. Overall it was my favorite because I learned alot of how to start my labs and my first lab in my computer science course which was exciting. 

Lab 7 
	Lab 7 was also my favorite to do because I had to implement the rules of parking on the streets based on their signs. Which I enjoyed doing because it felt like a puzzle at times although I believe it was pretty extensive. From this lab I learned how to input the size of my argument, as well as entering the specific variables, as well as making a bool variable which will return true when parking is allowed, and an if statement that would return true for all streets on days that you are allowed to park on and at what times you can park. 

Lab 9
	Lab 9 was also my favorite lab to do because it felt like one of the simpler labs for me to do compared to others. Where I had to simply set up the format of finding the scores, validating them as well as computing them. From this lab I was able to learn how to insert scores, compute, and adjust scores using doubles. Overall it was my favorite because it felt simpler to me and had less variables to be inputted.
